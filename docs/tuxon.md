Tuxon is a stereo Audio Player that can play WAV, MP3 and FLAC format audio files. Using its display and controls the user can drilldown into a specific area within the sample. The pattern for playing can be selected, one can choose between single, repeat and ping-pong (where the sample will be played normal and backwards depending on the direction). As the sample length can be set to whatever length the user wants (even 1 sample is possible) it can be perfectly used for granular synthesis. The player currently has cv-inputs to control the panning and to trigger stop/start for the player. By putting the begin line (green colour) to the right of the end line (red colour) the sample will be played backwards. 

## Controls
Below the top display are 6 buttons that can be pressed to control the sample. From left to right these buttons are **Play**, **Pause**, **Fast backward**, **Fast forward**, **Eject** and **Stop**.
Fast backward and Fast forward can be pushed until the Play line is at the position rquired. The other buttons van be controlled with a single push. 

When you push Eject you get the option to select and load a new file. The same can be achieved by going to the menu and pressing **Select Audio File**.

The **Start** and **End** knobs let you control the begin and ens position of the loaded sample. 

**Pan** gives you the option to pan the sound and can be modulated using the input next to the knob.

**Speeds** lets you play the sample faster or slower. 

**Volume** lets you control the volume, where the leds below give you an idea about the current level.

The **Zoom-In** and **Zoom-Out** buttons give you the option to drill down and get to access to a specific area in your sample. Ideal for granular synthesis. Make sure you change the begin and end markers, otherwise there is no reason and no possibility for the module to drill. 

The menu of the module gives you two additional control settings. One is the **Panningtype** (**Simple** or **Constant Power**) that can be selected and the other one is **PlayMode**. Here you can choose between:
**Single**, the sample will be played from the Begin postion till the End postion only once.
**Repeat**, the sample will be played from the Begin postion till the End postion until it is stopped by pressing the Pause or Stop button or by triggering using the **Play/Stop** CV-input.
**PingPong**, the sample will be played from the Begin postion till the End postion until it is stopped by pressing the Pause or Stop button or by triggering using the **Play/Stop** CV-input. When it reaches the begin or end position it will reverse its direction (which may result in playing the sample backwards ).
